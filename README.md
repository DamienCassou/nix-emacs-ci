# Emacs installations for continuous integration

This work-in-progress repo will provide a method for Emacs Lisp
authors to easily test their code against a wide variety of Emacs
versions.

The rationale for this is that [EVM](https://github.com/rejeep/evm)
and Damien Cassou's PPA are both unmaintained and have various issues.

Goals:

- Usable without Nix knowledge
- Clear, simple docs and setup, initially for Travis
- Binary caching if possible, via Cachix
- Both Linux *and* MacOS support
- Minimal installations by default: no images, no `window-system`
